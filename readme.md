# Arduino Powered Amiga Floppy Disk Reader and Writer
Created by Robert Smith @RobSmithDev 

# What is it?
This project uses an Arduino to interface with a floppy disk drive and communicate with a PC in order to recover the data from Amiga formatted AmigaDOS disks.
It also allows you to write a backed up ADF file back onto a floppy disk!

# ArduinoFloppyReader
